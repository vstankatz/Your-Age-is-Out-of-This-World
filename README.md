## Description

_This program was designed to allow someone to see their age according to other planets solar cycle._

|Specs|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|The program should take in a persons Earth age and make it a number. |"26"|26|
|The program should take in a persons life expectancy. |"100"|100|
|The Program should convert their age into the number of days lived in Earth solar years.|26|(26*365) = 9490|
|The Program should convert their life expectancy into days in Earth solar years.|100|(100*365) = 36500|
|The program should calculate their age into Mercury solar years.| 9490|(9490/87.97) = 107.88|
|The program should calculate their life expectancy into Mercury solar years.| 36500|(36500/87.97) = 414.91|
|The program should calculate their age into Venus solar years.| 9490|(9490/224.7) = 42.23|
|The program should calculate their life expectancy into Venus solar years.| 36500|(36500/224.7) = 162.44|
|The program should calculate their age into Mars solar years.| 9490|(9490/1.88) = 5047.87|
|The program should calculate their life expectancy into Mars solar years.| 36500|(36500/1.88) = 19414.89|
|The program should calculate their age into Jupiter solar years.| 9490|(9490/11.86) = 800.17|
|The program should calculate their life expectancy into Jupiter solar years.| 36500|(36500/11.86) = 3077.57|
|The program should calculate their days left to live on Earth.|(36500-9490)|27010|
|The program should calculate their days left to live on Mercury.|(414.91-107.88)|307.03|
|The program should calculate their days left to live on Venus.|(162.44-42.23)|120.21|
|The program should calculate their days left to live on Mars.|(19414.89-5047.87)|14567.02|
|The program should calculate their days left to live on Jupiter.|(3077.57-800.17)|2277.4|
|If the life expectancy is negative the program should convert the result into positive and display the number of years lived passed their expected demise.|Age:108, Expectancy: 100, (100-108)=-8|"8 years longer than expected"|
